# E2E umbrella Chart

This e2e umbrella Chart is a basis for end-to-end testing of an [Catena-X](https://catena-x.net/en/) automotive dataspace network
consisting of [Tractus-X](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/automotive.tractusx) OSS coponents.

The Chart aims for a completely automated setup of a fully functional network, that does not require manual setup steps.

## Installing

Running this Chart requires a kubernetes cluster `>1.24.x`. One of the options is to run a local instance of [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) setup.
Assuming you have a running cluster and your `kubectl` context is set to that cluster, you can use the following command to install
the Chart as `lab` release.

```shell
# Download (recursive chart dependencies) with hack script
hack/helm-dependencies.bash

cd charts/umbrella

helm install lab . --namespace lab --create-namespace
```

To forward the ports for accessing the IRS:

```shell
./forwardingPorts.sh
```
After that you can access the:
- IRS Frontend: http://localhost:3000


To taredown your setup, run:

```shell
helm delete lab --namespace lab
```
